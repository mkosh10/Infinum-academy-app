# ******Shows App******
### Description
The Show Review App is an Android application that allows users to explore a list of TV shows, view detailed information about each show, and submit reviews for shows they have watched. The app supports both online and offline modes, fetching data from an API when an internet connection is available and using a local database for offline access. 
I developed this app as part of my learning journey in the Infinum Academy Android course.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on an emulator or physical device.

### **Usage**
1. Launch the app to see the list of shows.
2. Tap on a show to view its details.
3. Submit a review by tapping on the "Submit Review" button and providing a comment and rating.
